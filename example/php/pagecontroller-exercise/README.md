Pagecontroller exercise
============================

This template contains a working website but there are some things missing that you should fix. Doing so you will have an opportunity to investigate the structure and layout of the template and try to understand how its stucture is, how to extend it and come to sense with if the structure is good and helpful.



Get going
----------------------------

Install the needed environment and developer tools.

```
composer install
```

Run the test suite to see that the setup is working as expected.

```
composer test
composer test-hard
```

You can remove all files and directories that were installed and generated by executin the following command.

```
composer clean-all
```



Page "Home"
----------------------------

1. Replace the text with your own version. You are free to express you as you wish.

1. Add something the the aside.



Page "Report"
----------------------------

1. The page "About" has content in its sidebar. Add a sidebar to the page "Report" that links internally to the different headings (Report from...) in the page.

1. Take your report text from the first kmom and add it to the "Report" page below the right heading. Write it in Markdown.

1. Roughly read the documentation on the [Markdown parser](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown) and find the code section that parses the text as Markdown to HTML.



Page "About"
----------------------------

1. Add content to this page. Reuse the content from your "About" in `me/report`.



Page "Server"
----------------------------

Use the `$_SERVER` and print the following at the top of the page.

1. The details on the referring page, the page visited before this page.

1. The details on the users browser.

1. The details on your web servers version.

1. The details on the request uri.

1. The number of entries (rows) in the array.



View "measure.php"
----------------------------

The view `view/measure.php` is visible on the page and "About".

1. Make it also visible on the page "Home" and "Report"

1. Show the load time in milliseconds (ms) and round to three decimals.

1. Show the memory used on kilobytes (KB).

1. Find data in the `$_SERVER` about the browser used to access the page, print it out.



View "figure.php"
----------------------------

1- Create a new view `view/figure.php` that helps you add an image `public/img/leaf_256x256.php`, wrapped in a figure element, onto the sidebar of the "About" page.



Page "Form GET"
----------------------------

You can see examples on form elements in the example `example/html/form-element`.

1. Add a select option to the form and see how it works.

1. Add an password field to the form and see how it works.

1. Add an checkbox (or two) to the form and see how it works.



Page "Form POST"
----------------------------

1. Do the same updates as in the GET form.

1. In the resultpage, print out details, in a reader friendly way.



Navbar
----------------------------

1. Read the article on how to make the current/selected page style differently in the navbar. You find the link to the article in the example code showing how its done, `example/php/style-active-navbar-item`.

1. Find the code, in this template, that is implementing the navbar and finding the current selected item. Do also find the related code in the stylesheet.



Page "Cookie"
----------------------------

Review the example on the page.

1. Answer the question "Why is it important with a processing page"?

1. Add a checkbox to the form. The checkbox should be checked when the cookie is active (have a value) and it should be unchecked when the cookie does not have a value. Make it readonly so the user can not change its state.

1. Calculate the number of cookies you have and print it out at the top of the page.

1. Consider, why are all these cookies there and what are they doing?

1. Find the cookies in the browser, they are sent with each request in the header of the request. You should see that the cookies and their values matches in the browser and in the server.

1. Consider, what does it mean that the cookies are visible in plain sight in the server? Can we store sensitive information in the cookies?



Page "Session"
----------------------------

1. Create a histogram for the dices rolled and show it together with the statistics on the dice rolls. You can create the histogram as you wish. Use plain figures, some text graphic, use form elements for graphic or even more advanced. Its fine to make the plain and simple choice, its just a matter of the visualisation.



Add a new pagecontroller
----------------------------

1. Create a new page, with a pagecontroller. You can name it as you wish and just add some message to it, perhaps "I'm now done with this exercise!" in bold and large text.



The page layout
----------------------------

1. Find the file that is carrying the page basic layout. Make some changes to it. Perhaps only by adding som text to the footer or do some larger changes based on your need to try out things.



Run the validation tools
----------------------------

Run the test suite to see if you are clean. if you get errors, see if you can fix them or just silently ignore them for another day.

```
composer test
```

You can also try to execute the following validators, they are a bit tougher and we will not try to correct their findings, if any. Not today at least. Another day.

```
composer psalm
composer phpstan
```
